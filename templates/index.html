    Build the Body of the Webpage Here.
    Use Bootstrap 5.3 and build the basic structure here for right now.
    For any values that will need to be replaced with a changing variable, 
      label it as a placeholeder with a comment stating its functionality, before sending a message to the GroupMe.
