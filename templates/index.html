<div>
    <!--
    This is the default webpage to which all users will be directed.
    To edit the layout of the content outside of this section, go to layout.html.
    Use Bootstrap 5.3 and build the basic structure here for right now.
    For any values that will need to be replaced with a changing variable, 
      label it as a placeholder with a comment stating its functionality, before sending a message to GroupMe.
    This is the format we will use for all the web pages.
