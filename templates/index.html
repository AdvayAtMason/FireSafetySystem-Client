    This is the default webpage all users will be directed to.
    Build the Body of the Webpage Here.
    Use Bootstrap 5.3 and build the basic structure here for right now.
    We will create a dedicated HTML5 file for the navbar and footer in the future.
    For any values that will need to be replaced with a changing variable, 
      label it as a placeholeder with a comment stating its functionality, before sending a message to the GroupMe.
    This is the format we will use for all the webpages.
